Assignment description:
You should write your code for each question in several .cpp and .h file
(please name it using the question name, e.g. q1.cpp). Please pack your
whole project into a single .zip file, name it using your student ID (e.g.
if your student ID is 123456, then the file should be named as
123456.zip), and then submit the .zip file via BB.
For this assignment, you don’t have to use the sample project. You can
create an empty project with QT Creater to start programming.
Please note that, the teaching assistant may ask you to explain the
meaning of your program, to ensure that the codes are indeed written
by yourself. Please also note that we may check whether your program
is too similar to your fellow students’ code using BB.
Please refer to the BB system for the assignment deadline. For each day
of late submission, you will obtain late penalty in the assignment marks.
If you submit more than three days later than the deadline, you will
receive zero in this assignment.
Detailed description on assignment requirement is stated in the last
few pages.
Question 1:
Question 2
Question Requirement
Q1:
You should write four files: calendar.h, calendar.cpp ,
p1.h and p1.cpp.
Of them,
➢ calendar.h should include the declaration of the
Month type, the functions daysInMonth and
isLeapYear.
➢ calendar.cpp should contains the implementation of
the two functions in calendar.h.
➢ p1.h should at least (You can write other functions
to simplify your program) include the declaration of
functions void p1().
➢ p1.cpp should include implementations for functions
declared in p1.h, the test method void p1(), which is
able to ask the user to input a year and then print
the number of days in each month of the year.
The sample output should be:
Q2:
You should write two files: p2.h and p2.cpp.
Of them,
➢ p2.h should at least (You can write other functions
to simplify your program) include declaration of
the two functions shown below.
void p2();
➢ p2.cpp should include implementations for functions
declared in p2.h. Of them, p2() is the test method
which contains the test program.
The test method void p2(), should be able to ask user
to input from console to specify the DNA strand to be
attached to and a shorter one. Then it output all the
positions after matching.
A sample output should be：
$Please input the longer DNA strand：TAACGGTACGTC
$Please input the shorter one：TGC
$The matching positions should be: 2, 7
Assignment Submission
Please put all required files in a single QT project which
is stated in the first line of each Question Requirement
Write a main.cpp file which includes a main function to
invoke different questions as follows：
The project layout:
After you test all your questions, zip the whole project
in one file named XXX.zip (XXX is your student ID and
your name is not required) and then submit it to the
BlackBorad (BB) system.
Marking scheme
For each question:
⚫ 20% Marks will be given to students who have
submitted the program on time.
⚫ 20% Marks will be given to students who wrote the
program that meet all the requirements of the
questions.
⚫ 20% Marks will be given to students who programs
that can be compiled without errors and warnings
⚫ 20% Marks will be given to students whose
programs produce the correct output if their
programs can be compiled.
⚫ 20% Marks will be given to students who
demonstrate good programming habit and style.
Q&A
1. How to check whether the assignment is submitted
on time?
We directly check it through BB system
2. How to check whether the assignment meets the
requirement?
a. A zip file containing the whole project is submitted
b. Zip filename is valid (studentID.zip)
c. All the required files stated in Each Question
Requirement should be included with correct
name.
d. The main.cpp with correct content should be
included.
e. The content of each file should satisfy the
requirement. For example, the declaration of p1()
should be in p1.h and its implementation should
be in p1.cpp.
f. No other additional files are included
3. How to check whether the assignment can be
compiled?
Note that we strongly suggest you to use the QT IDE
since your code tested on other IDE may not work on
QT. If you want to use other IDE, please test your
code again on QT to avoid such errors.
If the QT IDE generates any errors when building
your project, 20% mark will be missed for each
question. If any warnings are produced but your
code can run, 20% mark will be missed for all
questions.
4. How to check the assignment gives correct output?
We will run your code if it can be compiled (warnings
are tolerated). You test code should be correct and
output is also correct. User-friendly test code and
output is preferred.
5. How to check the programming style?
⚫ Comments.
You should include three kinds of comments in your
code:
a. File comments in the beginning of each code file,
for example，
b. Function comments just before each function
implementation. For example，
c. Statement comments on the right side of some
statements if necessary. You do not have to write
comments for each statement.
⚫ Code layout.
Beautiful !!!!
The following points should be pay attention to:
a. The indentation used
b. {} used for function, for structure, while structure,
switch structure.
c. meaningful variable name.
We strongly suggest you to adhere to the coding style
used in our textbook, which will be followed by us to
check your code.
